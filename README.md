Me, my brother Noah, and my sister Audrey picking out a Christmas tree in 2017.

I am a New Paltz graduate student, pursuing my master’s in computer science. I did my undergrad degree in computer science at New Paltz as well. My education has covered a broad range of topics falling under computer science and mathematics, and I’ve been programming since high school. The first computer language that I officially learned was Java, during my senior year of high school. But before that I had already been building my own computers, writing shell scripts, and using computers for everything from gaming to digital art. Two of my favorite areas within programming are cryptography and mobile development (Android), both of which were introduced to me during my studies at New Paltz. I collaborated on a mobile app for my senior project, and enjoyed learning the complexities of the Android API. I also created an ‘RSA Breaker’ app while I was studying abroad which factors a private decryption key using Euler’s Phi Function and the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Of course, it is essentially useless without a supercomputer. Nonetheless the source code can be found on my GitHub.

Web Programming to me, is daunting, because of how complicated it is and how frequently the technologies are changing. Even now I am re-taking this class because I got a C in it last Spring. However, I already feel like I am better off because of what I learned last year. Learning the various frameworks and deepening my knowledge of HTML and Javascript will be highly beneficial to me as a continue my career. One field that I am strongly considering working in after graduation is cybersecurity. Knowing how to build software that is stable or “airtight” in terms of vulnerabilities could one day help me in the field.
